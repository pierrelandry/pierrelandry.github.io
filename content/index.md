title: Welcome to my blog

Hello! My name is Pierre, and I'm a Data & AI architect. 
Over the past few years, my focus has primarily been on implementing Data & AI systems in production environments to deliver value to users. I have the expertise to contribute to almost every aspect of product development, including architecture, software delivery, data and machine learning (engineering and operations), and data science.

## WHY

First and foremost, I write for myself: to better condense my research and learning experiences.
As I accumulate years of experience, I've come to realize that recollecting certain concepts I've worked on takes more and more time. The ones I can easily recall are typically the ones I've capitalized on. Writing a blog allows me to synthesize my knowledge and refer back to it when needed. You can think of it as an index of my expertise. 

Then I write to share my knowledge, successes and failures. Once my thoughts are better organized, I can then share my content to disseminate, impart, and educate. Moreover, sharing allows me to provoke discussions, receive feedback, and learn new things, which ultimately enriches the initial goal.
  

## HOW

Then came the question of how to proceed. Being curious by nature, I am constantly learning new things, often through blogs and books. Sharing my knowledge in the form of a blog seemed the most natural solution.

However, quality blog posts usually take a long time to get from the idea stage to online publication. Between these two stages, there is a process of idea consolidation that I wanted to capture (a kind of lineage of my thoughts), and the traditional blog format didn't allow me to do this. In general, a blog post represents the culmination of a thought process and can take some time to mature, which can be a barrier to writing. Also, blog posts are linear and chronological.

This is where I stumbled upon the concept of a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) : a collection of notes, resources and projects. Some notes are in the exploratory stage, similar to a notebook, while others are more mature, similar to traditional blog posts. What I like about this idea is the concept of "growth": the notes evolve over time and are interconnected, materialized within this digital garden.

## WHAT

In this garden, you'll come across several types of notes:

- **Seeds**: These are the initial stages of my ideas. They are raw notes that can originate from blog articles, books, and more. They are notes taken without any specific structure.
    
- **Saplings**: After capturing raw notes, I may revisit them and decide to delve deeper into a particular concept or topic. Saplings are single nodes or thoughts.
    
- **Fruits**: Fruits are the result of merging multiple concepts together, reflecting the outcome of my thoughts combined. They can take the form of blog posts or projects.
    

So, welcome to my garden ðŸª´! I hope you will enjoy the journey.
